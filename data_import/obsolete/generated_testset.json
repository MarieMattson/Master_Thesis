            "Skills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not \"filled\") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don't or can't The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: \"I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you.\" \"I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language\""

Allyship & Empathy Being an Ally Requires Empathy {{< youtube \"1Evwgu369Jw\" >}} Responding with Empathy What to say, when you don’t know what to say: Acknowledgement of their pain. “I’m sorry you are going through this.” “That must be hard.” Share how you feel. “Wow. I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression). If someone says, “Ouch, you are stepping on my toes!” How do you react? Problems with common responses to mistakes become obvious: Centering the mistake around yourself: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn. Apologize for the impact, even though you didn’t intend it: “I’m sorry!” Stop the instance: move your foot Stop the pattern: be careful where you step in the future. When it comes to oppression, we want to actually change the “footwear” to get rid of privilege and oppression (sneakers for all!), but metaphors can only stretch so far!

Equality Ally Strategies Cultivate Equality at Work Communicating with Empathy Effective Listening Building Trust The importance of trust How to engage meaningfully in allyship and anti-racism - OPTIONAL Inclusive mindset of committed allies - OPTIONAL Session 2: The importance of being an ally and why you want to be an ally. Session 3: Work as a group to discuss a number of scenarios and how to tackle them as an ally. Session 4: Together, write a commitment to allyship and the values you will abide by to be an ally. In the last session you will decide as a group a short commitment statement that should be shared on the Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Sharing Page. Think about what you have individually and collectively learnt during the experience. Create 2-5 values that, as a group, you will hold in your continuous learning in allyship and take into account when situations arise. Once completed you now have a safe group to discuss allyship with, either to get advice, hold yourself accountable to or run through a situation.

There isn't one big activity we can take to accomplish this. Instead, it is a mix of numerous activities and behaviors combined to enable our team members to feel they belong in GitLab. Those activities and behaviors include: DIB Events DIB Advisory Group Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging TMRGs - Team Member Resource Groups Our Values Family and Friends first, Work second Inclusive language and pronouns Parental leave Asynchronous communication and workflows Tips for Companies Defining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging A great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms. An example is GitLab's Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don't create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company's current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global \"All Call\" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide \"why\" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits"

            "<1-hop>\n\ntitle: \"Sales Sponsorship Pilot Program\" description: \"A page for the Sales Sponsorship Pilot Program\" In 2023 we conducted a pilot program to address an imbalance of Black Team Members at job grade 9+ within Sales and lack of representation in sales leadership positions. The pilot program was designed to create pathways for Black Team Members to progress effectively at GitLab. We have since extended this program to promote pathways for all Sales team members to progress at GitLab. Mentorship vs Sponsorship Harvard Business Review defines the difference between sponsors versus mentors: “While a mentor is someone who has knowledge and will share it with you, a sponsor is a person who has power and will use it for you.” Mentoring is defined in our Mentoring at GitLab handbook page as: Mentor relationships are an opportunity for individuals to learn from someone's personal experience, background, and perspective. These relationships build trust on a team, provide safe space to make mistakes, and encourage both personal and professional development. Mentorship is an opportunity for both the mentor and mentee to develop their leadership and communication skills. Mentorship should be led by the mentee, similar to how 1:1's at GitLab are driven by direct reports. Sponsorship is defined using influence and/or power to support the growth and development of a team member. A sponsor is typically a senior leader with significant influence and responsibilities. A sponsor will then use this influence to but not limited to; advocating for career advancement opportunities, provide opportunities to upskills via active projects and provide visibility to other senior leaders and the business of the sponsees potential. Role of a Sponsor at GitLab A Sponsor is someone who has power and influence at GitLab and will use that power to advocate, elevate and impact a team members opportunities and career progression at GitLab. A sponsor at GitLab is: A Senior Leader at a minimum job grade 10+ and is not the sponsees direct manager. The senior leader should be a People Manager or Manager of Managers Must have been at GitLab for 6+ months Be able to commit to a 9 month sponsorship program which will include Sponsor Training Kick-off calls Bi-weekly 1-1 with Sponsee Be able to fully commit and be held accountable for their role within the Sponsorship Program As a Sponsor you should be: Be open and honest Listen and Learn Lean into discomfort in areas not familiar to you (e.g. cultural differences) Take risks with the relationship Advocate for your sponsee with intent Give feedback as appropriate Be intentional in building the relationship A sponsor will: Use their influence and power to advocate for the sponsee potential for career advancement Use their influence to increase the visibility of the sponsee amongst other Senior Leaders at GitLab Use their influence to increase the visibility of the sponsee at GitLab Provide opportunities and space for risk-taking and growth Provide feedback on growth and skill development The sponsorship relationship may not provide all the above but the sponsor should be willing and able to provide some of the opportunities above to the sponsor.",

The sponsor will add further suggestions throughout the program 1-1 conversation in a cadence agreed upon by the participants. We suggest a minimum of bi-weekly. Special projects & Sponsorship activities may mean cadence changes Quarterly All-Hands This will reinforce the ideals of the sponsorship program and ensure that the relationship is progressing through the phases. Individual Quarterly Feedback with DIB Team End of Program session with Sponsor Complete Next Step Documentation with Sponsor & Direct Manager to ensure progression continues Sponsor Sponsee Matching: A sponsor should be at least two job grades higher than the sponsee A sponsor and sponsee should be in a timezone that is practical to have 1-1s. Special projects etc can follow asynchronous principles If possible Sponsor should align with the career development plan of the sponsee What does a successful sponsorship look like? Build Take the time to build a solid relationship with each other. This will be particularly important if you have no previous direct working relationship and can often take some time to cultivate. It is very important to build the relationship first before moving into authentic sponsorship. Suggested Actions: Commit to regular 1-1s Understand the sponsees career development plan Set goals and expectations early Develop You have taken the time to build a relationship with each other, the next step is to develop that relationship by becoming action & capability focussed. In this step the sponsor will help guide the sponsee on areas of improvement in skills & capabilities. The sponsee is responsible for acting on feedback and being intentional about displaying these improvements to the sponsor. Suggested Actions: Find and seek opportunities for the sponsor to observe the sponsees improvement areas Sponsee invites Sponsor to a team meeting where they are presenting Sponsor invites sponsee to a working group Commit This is where both parties agree to move forward with the next step, which is sponsorship and advocating for the sponsee. This can take many forms, such as; a formal discussion, the sponsor outlining actions to the sponsee or at the sponsees request. This is an opportunity to provide feedback, any uncertainties and to reestablish career development goals. Suggested Actions: Participate in feedback session with sponsee Advocate Now that a commitment has been made and the sponsor is satisfied that the sponsee is ready for the next step.

            "<2-hop>\n\nSkills and Behaviors of allies To be an effective ally it is important to understand some of the skills and behaviors great allies exhibit. Active listening Neutral and nonjudgmental. Patient (periods of silence are not \"filled\") Verbal and nonverbal feedback to show signs of listening (e.g., smiling, eye contact, leaning in, mirroring) Asking questions. Reflecting back what is said. Asking for clarification. Summarizing. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence An example of this could be: A colleague comes to you and tells you that their pronouns are being misused often at work and it is making them feel uncomfortable and they are avoiding social calls and interactions. Whilst you haven’t experienced this yourself and unlikely you would experience this, you allow yourself to think of situations where you have felt uncomfortable at work before. You also put yourself consciously into the shoes of your colleague and think of a way you can practically help. You offer to your colleague that in the next 5 calls they participate in you will be on the call and actively point out misuse of their pronouns to other colleagues to take away some of the emotional burden. Active learning about other experiences You go beyond performative actions for example black squares on Instagram for Black Lives Matter, but actively does the work to understand the pain, struggle and experience of those burdened. This could look like: You are managing black team members, an incident has occurred externally that could affect the mental health of those team members. You actively research the experience and historical context of the trauma associated with the incident. You use this to ensure you are informed and able to appropriately apply empathy if a team member approaches you to ask for assistance. Humility Non-defensive Willingness to take on feedback You aren’t going to get it right all the time and you have to be ok with that. Be willing to take feedback on and not let it deter you from continuing to be an ally. Example of this could be: You are in a safe space with an underrepresented group acting as an ally and absorbing information. A point comes up that you are passionate about and you talk over someone in the group and take over the conversation. After the meeting someone from the group jumps on a Zoom meeting with you and explains that it felt you took away the viewpoints of a number of people from the URG because you took over the conversation and interrupted an individual. You apologize, take on the feedback, ask for any tips on how to make sure it doesn’t happen again and take the necessary steps. --- One of the mistakes that often happens here is being defensive or justifying the action. The group will already know you are operating with good intent but generally are wanting to help you level up in their lived experience. Courage Comfortable getting uncomfortable Speak up where others don't or can't The empathy example is also a good example of this. Self-awareness Own and use your privilege This could look like: You are in a product meeting and the meeting will be making critical decisions about the product roadmap for the next three months and you notice that everyone in the meeting is of the same gender and race. You use your privileged situation in the meeting to point this out and ask the people in the meeting. Who should be invited to ensure we are getting a diverse perspective and viewpoint on the agenda items for the meeting? Action orientated You see something, you say something The example above is a good example of this: Ensure decisions and conversations have diverse voices. I.E. you are in a meeting and everyone looks the same, insist on other perspectives. In a group setting when a discussion or comment is verbalized that could be controversial use language similar to this to course correct the conversation: \"I would like us all to be aware of our language and/or acknowledgements and ensure we are being respectful to all individuals. Thank you.\" \"I am practicing being an ally and as a reminder I would like to ensure we are all using inclusive language\"",

I don’t know what to say.” “It makes me really sad to hear this happened.” Show Gratitude that the person opened up. “Thank you for sharing with me.” “This must be hard to talk about. Thanks for opening up to me.” Show Interest. “How are you feeling about everything?” “Is there anything else you want to share?” Be Encouraging. “You are brave / strong / talented.” “You matter.” Be Supportive. “I’m here for you.” “I’m happy to listen any time.” Boot and Sandal Methophor Imagine you are wearing a heavy boot (represents privilege) and you are stepping on someone’s foot that is only wearing sandals (represents oppression).

I’m a good person!” Denial that others’ experiences are different from your own: “I don’t mind when people step on my toes.” Derailing: “Some people don’t even have toes, why aren’t we talking about them instead?” Refusal to center the impacted: “All toes matter!” Tone policing: “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely.” Denial that the problem is fixable: “Toes getting stepped on is a fact of life. You’ll be better off when you accept that.” Victim blaming: “You shouldn’t have been walking around people with boots!” Withdrawing: “I thought you wanted my help, but I guess not. I’ll just go home.” Instead, you would respond with the following: Center the impacted: “Are you okay?” Listen to their response and learn.

There isn't one big activity we can take to accomplish this. Instead, it is a mix of numerous activities and behaviors combined to enable our team members to feel they belong in GitLab. Those activities and behaviors include: DIB Events DIB Advisory Group Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging TMRGs - Team Member Resource Groups Our Values Family and Friends first, Work second Inclusive language and pronouns Parental leave Asynchronous communication and workflows Tips for Companies Defining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging A great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms. An example is GitLab's Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don't create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company's current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global \"All Call\" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide \"why\" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits"

A DIB roundtable is a great way to build deeper connections with team members and develop safe spaces to discuss DIB related issues. The DIB roundtable will ask team members to share stories and anecdotes as well as challenge team members to think about how they personally and collectively can positively impact DIB. We have two avenues for DIB Roundtables: DIB Programmed Roundtables - The DIB Team creates a programmed roundtable(s) on a quarterly basis to discuss a pre-defined topic. Self-Organized - A TMRG, Team Members, Managers can organized a roundtable to discuss DIB related issues. Starting a roundtable Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Team Programmed The DIB Team will organize DIB Roundtables on a quarterly basis with a maximum of two roundtables in a quarter. The DIB Team will program the quarterly roundtable on the team calendar when the decision has been made on the topics for the quarter The DIB team will create an agenda with a series of questions for the quarterly roundtable The roundtable will last 50mins and be split as followed: 10mins: DIB Facilitator will set the topic and provide some context 30mins: The DIB Facilitator will divide the group into small groups of 5/6 team members to discuss the questions in the agenda 10mins: Debrief The DIB Team will ask for a volunteer or are elect group facilitator for each group, your role is to: Verbalize the questions Ensure that everyone, including yourself gets an opportunity to contribute Share your screen where necessary i.e. slides or tasks Programmed Roundtables: Date & Times Subject DIB Facilator TMRG (if applicatble) TBC Allyship Liam McNally N/A TBC Bias Liam McNally N/A TBC Microaggressions TBC NA Self-organized First, identify a group of team members who would like to participate.

            "<2-hop>\n\nTips for Managers Set aside time to show up for planned DIB events You may be surprised by how much seeing your face in these events validates this as a worthwhile use of time which is valued by the company. Seeing you in attendance also opens the door to future conversations that might begin with: \"I saw you in XYZ meeting, what did you think of such-and-such topic?\" Incorporate DIB into your team meetings Connecting to team members is key to understand who they are and what they bring to the team. A great initial step is to start with open discussions. You could start by opening your next team meeting to chat about what they feel inclusion looks like, what is important to them as a team to feel included, etc. This could then move into monthly or quarterly team DIB icebreakers, trainings, etc. The idea is to make sure DIB is not touched on once and never mentioned again, but more of an understood aspect of your team environment. You can do this by setting and communicating DIB goals for your team, and sharing how we will measure success (an idea could be sharing DIB survey data with team members). Encourage Diversity of Thought and Speaking Up Don’t assume you know more than others. Give people a chance to add their perspective or expertise. Teach people how to disagree, set the expectation that it is OK to disagree, and encourage people to do it day-to-day. Celebrate diverse thoughts and thank people for making contributions, particularly if they disagree with you. It takes courage to disagree publicly with a leader. Connect with your team members To help team members feel comfortable being themselves, leaders should consider authentic ways to connect to their team members. Everyone wants to feel visible and included in order to perform their best work. Being visible usually includes being seen for accomplishments, acknowledgment of contributions, what is the same, and what differs from team member to team member. Leaders and all team members should show an interest in and respect for differences and contributions. Considerations could be that of language/terminology such as “spouses” or “partners” instead of making assumptions about team members sexual orientation. Being considerate of dietary restrictions when choosing food options for Contribute or other local gatherings. Acknowledging birthdays, recalling personal things that might have been mentioned in past calls such as moving to a new home, an ill family member or team member, and following up authentically. For more information see our Inclusive Language. Ask employees what pronouns they use Pronouns are a large piece of a person's identity and are often used to communicate a person’s gender, which is why it is so important to get it right. Asking for a person's pronouns and using those pronouns consistently shows that you respect their identity, but it also helps to create a more welcoming, safe, and supportive environment where people can feel comfortable being themselves. This is a change that goes a long way to foster inclusion. Be mindful of the times of your meetings It's important to consider global times and alternating meetings to accommodate regions. Be mindful of families, commitments, observances, holidays, and meeting times that may be out of team members' working hours. Every meeting time won't be perfect for everyone (which is why all meetings have an agenda), but making a conscious effort to alternate times is to ensure the same people aren't being excluded. For more, view our Inclusive Meetings operating principle. Be a Role Model As a manager, you are in a unique position to model good DIB practices for the rest of your team. Be authentic, own up to mistakes, and commit to doing better next time. Don’t dwell on it. Set a good example by admitting that you make mistakes and invite people to help you and each other by speaking up in accordance with our feedback guidelines. By holding each other accountable, we get better as a team."

Additionally, connecting authentically with team members by acknowledging their contributions and respecting differences, such as using correct pronouns and being considerate of dietary restrictions, fosters a more inclusive environment.

            "<1-hop>\n\nTips for Team Members Schedule a Coffee Chat with a Team Member Understanding GitLab is fully remote, there is an opportunity to get to know team members beyond your geographical location as well as outside of your division. This provides an opportunity to: learn more about other cultures and work divisions cultivate better global communication make progress toward building an inclusive environment Coffee chats are suggested during onboarding but you don't need to stop there. It is recommended to continue this action whenever you would like to. Please take a look at our GitLab team page and feel free to select someone for a coffee chat! Hold Each Other Accountable Hold each other accountable and speak up when someone uses non-inclusive language. We should also celebrate when we are inclusive, and strive to support each other every day. Avoid Identity Assumption Statements Identity is a personal thing. Looks or names can imply diverse attributes, but they are not perfect identity indicators. Avoid making statements about someone's perceived race, gender, age, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. When people are typecast or feel misunderstood, they are less likely to feel that they belong. Tip to Uncover Unconscious Bias When you are dealing with a specific situation, you can mentally flip the situation around and see how that feels. For example, flip it from a woman to a man, and if it feels off then you might have a bias. By putting ourselves in someone else's shoes, we can better understand their point of view and be more supportive.

            "<2-hop>\n\ntitle: \"Building an Inclusive Remote Culture\" description: \"We are passionate about all remote working and enabling an inclusive work environment.\" We are passionate about all remote working and enabling an inclusive work environment. There isn't one big activity we can take to accomplish this. Instead, it is a mix of numerous activities and behaviors combined to enable our team members to feel they belong in GitLab. Those activities and behaviors include: DIB Events DIB Advisory Group Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging TMRGs - Team Member Resource Groups Our Values Family and Friends first, Work second Inclusive language and pronouns Parental leave Asynchronous communication and workflows Tips for Companies Defining Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging A great place to begin is to set a foundation of the basic understanding of how your company defines these terms. An example is GitLab's Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging value, supported by an evolving list of operating principles. In other places, you may hear them used interchangeably. Understanding their differences is essential to driving the initiatives. As an example, you may hire many diverse candidates, but if you don't create an inclusive environment the work can be in vain. Evaluating the company's current DIB landscape Consider what you are already doing in this space. What is the current feedback? What are team members saying with company engagement surveys? What are the goals you are wanting to achieve? What are the metrics saying? Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging survey A company survey is a great way to get a sense of team members' thoughts and concerns. The DIB team at GitLab runs an annual survey via CultureAmp to gauge where we are as a company in terms of diversity, inclusion & belonging. We take the results and implement projects and solutions based on insights from the survey results. Naming this body of work Although Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging are often understood globally, there are other terms that can be leveraged to name your efforts. The naming should be unique to your company. Examples could include Belonging, Inclusion & Collaborations, etc. Developing a mission statement When creating a diverse and inclusive culture, most companies will develop a mission statement to support their vision. Your mission statement should articulate the purpose of your strategy. In a few sentences, you should be able to succinctly provide the why and the how. Be sure to take into account your company’s current overall mission and vision. It is best to align your DIB mission and vision with your organization’s overarching mission and vision. To do this, you may consider how your DIB Strategy can build on, scale, or enhance the organization’s mission and vision. Creating TMRGs In general, TMRGs are an excellent support system and key to providing awareness, respect, and building diversity, inclusion & belonging within the workplace. These groups are a proven way to increase cultural competency, retention of team members, provide marketplace insights to the business, attract diverse talent, and more. The endorsement of TMRGs allows team members to identify common interests and decide how they can be shared with others. When creating TMRGs there are a few initial steps to consider: Creating guidelines to help support TMRGs being stood up within your company Naming of each TMRG Roles within each TMRG Aligning to company strategy Creating forms, Google groups, ways of tracking attendance for TMRG events, and membership metrics Creating a Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Advisory Group Consider creating this group as your highest level of global voices: a team of company influencers who can be instrumental in driving DIB efforts from a global perspective. How do you do this? GitLab conducted a global \"All Call\" for those who would be interested in joining and advised them to provide \"why\" DIB was important to them, along with other questions such as division, location, etc. When we were reviewing we were able to have the best possible outcome of representation across the globe. Additional support in sustaining the group would be: DIB Advisory group guidelines Appointing an Executive sponsor from the company Designating leads of the group Deciding on when it is time to enact or rotate the opportunity for new advisory group members More to come DIB Initiatives DIB Awards for Recognition DIB Surveys DIB Framework Inclusive Benefits"
